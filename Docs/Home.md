# OktaPS
OktaPS is a PowerShell module for Okta administration. Supports credential, private key, and API authentication. It wraps the official (and unofficial) Okta APIs in a PowerShell-esque way to make administering Okta easy via command line. 

Some commands are slightly opinionated, however, it tries to stay true to the API as much as possible.
