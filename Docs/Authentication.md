# Authentication

## Credential
Credential is probably the easiest to start without having to set anything else up.

## API Key
You can use API key for headless, but need to keep it alive.

## PrivateKey
Private Key is recommended for server-side applications since you can scope exactly what permissions the key should
have access to.
